```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## **Problem 1**
#### **Part a**: 
```{r}
library(car)
dim(Salaries)
head(Salaries)
```

#### **Part b**: Assuming same slope the professor has a way higher starting salary than associate professor.
```{r}
plot(salary~yrs.service, col=rank, data=Salaries)
summary(lm(salary~yrs.service+rank, data=Salaries))
```

#### **Part c**: Intercepts based on rank
#### **Part d**: Not the clearest. Although it provides more possible adjustments, the adjusted R^2 value is lower but R^2 value is higher.
```{r}
summary(lm(salary~yrs.service*rank, data=Salaries))
```

<br>

## **Problem 2**: 
```{r}
model <- lm(salary~yrs.service+rank, data=Salaries)
newx <- data.frame(yrs.service=c(6), rank=c("AsstProf"))
predict(model, newx, interval="prediction")
```
