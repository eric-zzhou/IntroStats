## Getting Data
```{r}
wa.mortality <- c(27, 49, 20, 10, 38, 29, 7, 6, 12, 18, 4, 9, 2, 7, 13, 0.5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 14, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
wa.mortality
```


## Creating Histogram
```{r}
hist(wa.mortality, breaks=5, xlab="Number of Deaths", main="Mortality by County in WA (June 2020)", col="turquoise")
abline(v=mean(wa.mortality), col="blue")
abline(v=median(wa.mortality), col="orange")
